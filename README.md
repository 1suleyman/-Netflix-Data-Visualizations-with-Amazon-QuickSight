# üìä Netflix Data Visualizations with Amazon QuickSight

In this project, I explore **Netflix data** using **AWS S3** and **Amazon QuickSight**, turning raw datasets into interactive, insightful visualizations.

I use this project to answer questions like:

* How do movies vs. TV shows compare over the years?
* What trends exist in release years and genres?
* How can I store, prepare, and visualize a dataset in the cloud?

## Step 1: Store the Dataset in Amazon S3

I start by putting my dataset in the cloud so QuickSight can access it easily.

1. **Create a new S3 bucket**

   I named mine: `nextwork-quicksight-suleyman`

2. **Upload my files**

   * I uploaded the `netflix_titles.csv`.
   * I updated the `manifest.json` file with the S3 URL of my CSV file, then uploaded it to the bucket.

3. **Take a screenshot**

   Here‚Äôs my S3 bucket with both files uploaded:

## Step 2: Create My Amazon QuickSight Account

Next, I set up **QuickSight**, where my data becomes interactive visualizations.

1. I signed up for the **free trial** of QuickSight Enterprise.

   * ‚ö†Ô∏è I made sure to **uncheck optional add-ons** (like Paginated Reports) to avoid charges.
   * I used the **same email as my AWS account** to prevent access issues.
   * I selected the **same AWS region** as my S3 bucket.

2. I gave QuickSight **access to my S3 bucket**:

3. QuickSight took a minute to be ready after setup:

## Step 3: Connect My S3 Bucket to QuickSight

Now it‚Äôs time to **link my dataset** to QuickSight.

1. I navigated to **Datasets ‚Üí New dataset ‚Üí S3**.

2. I entered the following:

   * **Source name**: `kaggle-netflix-data`

     > This is just a label to remind me what this dataset is about (Netflix titles from Kaggle).
   * **Manifest URL**: S3 URL of my `manifest.json`

üí° The `manifest.json` file acts like a **map**, telling QuickSight where my data lives and how to interpret it.

3. I clicked **Visualize** and confirmed the connection:

4. I took a screenshot of the **dataset connection**:

## Step 4: Create My First QuickSight Visualization

Time to bring my Netflix data to life!

1. I explored the dataset fields and dragged them into **visualizations**.

2. I created my first visuals:

   * **Pie chart**: distribution of `rating`
   * **Horizontal bar chart**: `release_year` vs `type` (Movies/TV Shows)

3. Screenshot of my visualizations:

## üí° What I Learned

* Uploading datasets to **AWS S3**
* Preparing data with **manifest.json** for QuickSight
* Connecting **S3 datasets to QuickSight**
* Creating **interactive visualizations** and dashboards
